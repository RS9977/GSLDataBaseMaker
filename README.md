# GSLDataBaseMaker

CopyAndRun.sh should be copied in the main directory of gsl after extraction from tar. and the gsl should be in the same directory as DataBaseBuilder that contains all these files.

AddDotC.sh is for changing ssa format to c format. So it should be whereever all the trees are copied.

Note: Make sure you've run the configure file in the GSL directory
